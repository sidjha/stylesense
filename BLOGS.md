# Press release

We released Stylesense to the world today: www.stylesen.se.

It lets you vote between 2 fashionable Instagrams. Got the idea when I noticed a few of my friends post #OOTD pics regularly, and I wanted to do something more than a mundane 'like' or comment. Stylesense version 1 was built on Wed night of last week by 2 people and we shared it initially with friends to get feedback. Once we got some good feedback, we spent a week refining the app - improved the quality of photos and made the rating algorithm more sophisticated. 

Fashion is cool because it's an expression of yourself. But the idea of pleasing the eye of the observer is fundamental to fashion. If other people are attracted by what you wear, you've succeeded. Everything is relative. And that's what Stylesense's proposition is. We're solving that by crowdsourced outfit comparison. Our mission is to be the world's favourite tool to compare outfits.

We'd like people who care about the intersection of fashion and technology to take a look. Like it? Let us know!
