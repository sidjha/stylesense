# Press release

<journalist name>,

We just launched Stylesense to the world and it's starting to gain steam. Stylesense lets people pick a winner from 2 Instagram outfits. Right now we do this with the help of the Instagram API by collecting pictures tagged #ootd. When someone visits stylesen.se, they're shown 2 random outfits so that they can pick the one they like better. Our system accumulates the votes, runs a sexy algorithm that factors in time of posting and shows a leader board representing the hottest outfits on Instagram. Once a week, we profile these fashionable people on our Instagram account.

We're from the University of Waterloo (it's in Canada) and we hacked on this project for 3 days. 

Without further ado, I urge you to check it out by visiting the first link below. (Be warned, it may reduce your productivity at work!)

Do you want to write about us? I've also appended below a link to screenshots.
