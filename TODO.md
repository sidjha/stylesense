# Must have
- responsiveness
- ability to vote
- ability to view leaderboard
- show previous round's score after the round/result
- analytics
  - keep track of how many rounds a visitor plays

# Nice to have
- authentication + deauthentication
- selecting own picture
- personal leaderboard
- user score when logged in
- analytics
  - track each action (ex: vote, skip, auth, deauth, etc) so we can set up funnels
